## 🛠️ **What Was Fixed:**

The issue was that Next.js in production mode only binds to `localhost` (127.0.0.1) by default, making it inaccessible from external networks. 

**Solution**: Started the application with `--hostname 0.0.0.0` to bind to all network interfaces.

- ✅ **Application Running**: PM2 process active
- ✅ **External Access**: Available on port 3000
- ✅ **Database Working**: PostgreSQL with sample data

## 🎉 **Success!**
