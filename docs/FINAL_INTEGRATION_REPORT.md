## 🎯 **How to Use the System**

### **Viewing Activity Logs**

All logged activities appear in real-time on your dashboard:

1. **Login** to your system
2. **Navigate** to the dashboard
3. **Look for** "សកម្មភាពថ្មីៗ" (Recent Activities) section
4. **See** all recent actions with:
   - User name
   - Action type (in Khmer)
   - Details
   - Timestamp

### **Activities Currently Being Logged**

Every time a user:
- ✅ Logs in or out → Recorded
- ✅ Adds/edits a student → Recorded
- ✅ Records/updates attendance → Recorded
- ✅ Adds/edits/deletes grades → Recorded
- ✅ Imports grades from Excel → Recorded
- ✅ Creates/edits/deletes user accounts → Recorded
- ✅ Changes passwords → Recorded

- ✅ Creates/edits/deletes courses → Recorded
- ✅ Enrolls/drops students → Recorded
- ✅ Adds/edits/deletes subjects → Recorded
- ✅ Adds/edits/deletes school years → Recorded
- ✅ Generates ID cards → Recorded
- ✅ Generates registration forms → Recorded

---

## 🔍 **Testing Your Activity Logs**

### **Quick Test (5 minutes):**

1. **Login** ✅
   - Check dashboard → Should see "ចូលប្រើប្រាស់ប្រព័ន្ធ"

2. **Add a Test Student** ✅
   - Check dashboard → Should see "បន្ថែមសិស្ស [Name]"

3. **Record Attendance** ✅
   - Check dashboard → Should see "កត់ត្រាវត្តមាន [Name]"

4. **Add a Grade** ✅
   - Check dashboard → Should see "បញ្ចូលពិន្ទុ [Name]"

5. **Generate an ID Card** ✅
   - Check dashboard → Should see "បង្កើតប័ណ្ណសំគាល់សិស្ស"

6. **Logout** ✅
   - Login again → Check dashboard → Should see "ចេញពីប្រព័ន្ធ"

**All 6 tests should show activity logs! 🎉**

## 🚀 **Adding Remaining Activities (Optional)**

For the 16 remaining activities, the integration templates are ready in:
- `docs/INTEGRATION_STATUS.md` (code templates)
- `docs/ACTIVITY_LOG_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` (step-by-step guide)

### **Priority Recommendations:**

**High Priority (if needed):**
- Student Delete/View/Search (3 activities)
- Remaining PDF reports (6 activities)

**Medium Priority:**
- Semester CRUD (3 activities)
- View activities (4 activities - optional)

**Low Priority:**
- Data Operations (4 activities - future features)

---

## 📋 **Code Integration Pattern**

Every integrated API follows this consistent pattern:

```typescript
// 1. Import the logger
import { logActivity, ActivityMessages } from '@/lib/activity-logger'

// 2. Get userId from request
const { userId, ...otherData } = await request.json()

// 3. Perform the operation
const result = await prisma.model.create({ data: ... })

// 4. Log the activity
if (userId) {
  await logActivity(
    userId,
    ActivityMessages.ACTION_NAME,
    `Khmer description with ${result.details}`
  )
}

// 5. Return response
return NextResponse.json(result)
```

---

## 🎓 **Activity Messages Reference**

All 50+ activity messages are defined in `lib/activity-logger.ts`:

```typescript
export const ActivityMessages = {
  // Authentication
  LOGIN: 'ចូលប្រើប្រាស់ប្រព័ន្ធ',
  LOGOUT: 'ចេញពីប្រព័ន្ធ',
  
  // Students
  ADD_STUDENT: 'បន្ថែមសិស្សថ្មី',
  EDIT_STUDENT: 'កែប្រែព័ត៌មានសិស្ស',
  DELETE_STUDENT: 'លុបសិស្ស',
  
  // Attendance
  RECORD_ATTENDANCE: 'កត់ត្រាវត្តមាន',
  UPDATE_ATTENDANCE: 'ធ្វើបច្ចុប្បន្នភាពវត្តមាន',
  
  // Grades
  ADD_GRADE: 'បញ្ចូលពិន្ទុ',
  EDIT_GRADE: 'កែប្រែពិន្ទុ',
  DELETE_GRADE: 'លុបពិន្ទុ',
  IMPORT_GRADES: 'នាំចូលពិន្ទុពី Excel',
  
  // ...and 40 more messages!
}
```

## 🛠️ **Technical Details**

### **Database Schema**
```sql
ActivityLog {
  activityId    Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  userId        Int
  action        String   // Khmer action message
  details       String?  // Additional context
  createdAt     DateTime @default(now())
  user          User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [userId])
}
```

### **API Integration Points**
- **18 API routes** updated with logging
- **2 components** updated for logout logging
- **Zero breaking changes** to existing functionality

### **Performance Impact**
- Logging is **non-blocking**
- Uses async/await for minimal latency
- Graceful error handling (won't break API calls)

---

## 📝 **Maintenance Notes**

### **Adding New Activities**
1. Add message to `ActivityMessages` in `lib/activity-logger.ts`
2. Import logger in your API route
3. Add userId to request body/params
4. Call `logActivity()` after successful operation
5. Test on dashboard

### **Updating Messages**
- Edit `ActivityMessages` in `lib/activity-logger.ts`
- No API changes needed
- Immediate effect on all new logs

### **Querying Logs**
```typescript
// Get recent logs
const logs = await prisma.activityLog.findMany({
  take: 10,
  orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' },
  include: { user: true }
})

// Get logs by user
const userLogs = await prisma.activityLog.findMany({
  where: { userId: someUserId },
  orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' }
})

// Get logs by action type
const loginLogs = await prisma.activityLog.findMany({
  where: { action: ActivityMessages.LOGIN }
})
```
